    ### 3.3.2 How to find the optimal value of the hyperparameter? (Contributor: Daxie - Stanford University)
    
    There are always some difficult hyperparameters when using machine learning algorithms. For example, weight attenuation size, Gaussian kernel width, and so on. The algorithm does not set these parameters, but instead requires you to set their values. The set value has a large effect on the result. Common practices for setting hyperparameters are:
    
    1. Guess and check: Select parameters based on experience or intuition, and iterate over.
    2. Grid Search: Let the computer try to evenly distribute a set of values within a certain range.
    3. Random search: Let the computer randomly pick a set of values.
    4. Bayesian optimization: Using Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters, it is difficult to meet the Bayesian optimization algorithm itself.
    5. Perform local optimization with good initial guessing: this is the MITIE method, which uses the BOBYQA algorithm and has a carefully chosen starting point. Since BOBYQA only looks for the nearest local optimal solution, the success of this method depends largely on whether there is a good starting point. In the case of MITIE, we know a good starting point, but this is not a universal solution, because usually you won't know where the good starting point is. On the plus side, this approach is well suited to finding local optimal solutions. I will discuss this later.
    6. The latest global optimization method for LIPO. This method has no parameters and is proven to be better than a random search method.
